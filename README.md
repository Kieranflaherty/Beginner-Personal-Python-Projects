# Python Personal Beginner Projects

Here are a series of Python projects that I have developed throughout the learning process whihc all include both a front end using Tkinter. Below is the current list of projects I have created.

### Social Media Bookmark Application

This is a Tkinter application which allows you to store bookmarks to your social media accounts so that you can quickly access all of your accounts from one place.

### Password Storage Application

This is also a TKinter application which allows you to store your login details. The program takes an entry from a user and saves it in a text file on your PC for username, password and website. It will append the text file as you add new passwords. This was purely for learning and I definitely would not reccomend it to be used as secure way to store passwords!!
